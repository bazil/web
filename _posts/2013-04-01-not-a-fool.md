Hi. This blog post establishes the Bazil.org project. This is not an
April Fool's joke.

There are more ambituous things floating in the background, but many
people have expressed interest in this, here's an early release: a Go
FUSE filesystem programming library.

This is based on [Russ Cox](http://swtch.com/~rsc/)'s fuse library, as
hosted at https://code.google.com/p/rsc/source/browse/#hg%2Ffuse

Here's how to get going:

    go get bazil.org/fuse

The github repository is at https://github.com/bazillion/fuse
